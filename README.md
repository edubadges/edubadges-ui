## Development Quickstart

1. Ensure you have docker and docker-compse. Modern docker-desktop provides both for all architectures.
2. Run `docker compose build`
3. Run `docker compose up`

This will:

* install dependencies with yarn only inside of the docker image
* set the configurations right to connect to a edubadges-server running on localhost:8000[^1]
* mount your working directory, with the source code into the container
* run a devserver in the container, with hot reload, logging and exposed on the container expoed port

## Development on local machine

Alternative to Docker is to run it locally on the machine. This requires yarn
and the right nodejs versions (TODO: what are these?).

```
yarn install
```

Before we start the dev server, we should create an env.js file that can be served by the dev server.

Create a file `public/env.js` with content matching your own values. Refer to
`src/util/config.js` for the variables and their defaults.

For example:
```
var SERVER_URL = "http://localhost:8000";
var EXTENSIONS_ROOT_URL = "http://localhost:8000";
var EDU_ID = "https://mijn.test.eduid.nl";
```

Then run the dev server:

```
yarn dev
```

When you build the bundles using:
```
yarn build
```
It will generate a statistics file: `public/stats.json` which you can use to analyze the bundle:
```
yarn stats
```
